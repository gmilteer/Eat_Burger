# Eat_Burger

Is a good app to learn the use of express-handlebars. I ask the user to add Hamburber names and people names, then to assign who is goint to eat the which hamberger. Each entered hamburger appears on one side of the screen, once the eater has been assign it is move to the other side of the screen. Is a good excersice to learn how to change where information it is display on an app and move it as the state of the information changes.

## Getting Started

- Before starting you need to install Nodejs and npm (node package manager) this is the official line for the documentation

## Installing and Starting the app locally

Clone the app from this repository to you local drive of you PC and go to the root directory of the project, then run the command

```
npm install
```

This will take only a few minuts, the packages are small, and it should install node modules within the server directory. For the client side since the project express-handlebars, the npm install will install the package necesary for the handlebars views to run in the server and render in the browser.

After both installations are complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:8080>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
